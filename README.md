This is a personal project that uses the Spotify API and OpenWeatherMap's Weather API [WIP]

## Technologies Used
- React with TypeScript
- Next.js

## Purpose
This is a project I first started as an art project and I finally wanted to finish it.
I also wanted to accomplish:
- Learn Next.js to practice Server-Side Rendering
- Practice responsive styling
- Practice UI design
- Practice using external APIs and learn more about Auth with PKCE
- Create something cool :)

## Current TODO

[x] Successfully get Weather data (and display some basics)

[x] Set-up Spotify Auth with PKCE

[ ] Modify code to use Application state instead of Component State for Weather/Spotify data
